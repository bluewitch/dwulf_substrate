 Each pallet will be implimented starting with Balances, to provide coin/tokens, all are
 premined and stakeable to generate rewards.

Pallets (to be implimented)
Balances
Included in the Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularised Entities (FRAME), 
defines a cryptocurrency for the DoW blockchain (for the coins, 1,000,000,000 one billion)

Atomic Swap
Will allow full swapability with any other token, currently DOT, ADA, ETH, and BTC More to follow and bridges are built
